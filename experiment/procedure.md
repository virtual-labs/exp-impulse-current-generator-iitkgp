## Procedure

1. When the page is loaded user is presented with input parameters namely Charging voltage(VO),Ground Capacitance(Cg),Front Resistance(Rf),Load Resistance(Rl),) loaded with default values on left frame and a circuit representation of ICG on right frame.
2. Drag your mouse on simulator part to see the impulse current generator testing apparatus in details. You can also zoom in it by scrolling your mouse for detail study of impulse current generator.
3. The user can conduct the experiment with the default values, However the parameters can also be changed and the experiment performed.
4. The parameters can be changed by adjusting slider position
5. Click on start Experiment
6. Then click on open ground switch to give supply to impulse current generator and you can see it in simulator
7. The Charge Capacitor button is to be clicked to charge generator capacitors.Charging time of capacitor is displayed by bar on left corner of simulator
8. The Trigger generator button is to be clicked to display the mechanism of impulse current generator.
9. After complete the process the respective graph will be shown. View the waveform carefully how waveform is changing with variation in parameters.
10. Mouse-hover on wave to see the variation of generated voltage with time. You can drag it or Zoom In/Zoom Out the wave form for detail study.
11. Find out Front time and tail time from the wave from (how to find out front time and tail time you have to see theory part).
12. After finding front time and tail time you can compare the generated Impulse wave with standard switching impulse wave.
